# Prod-Dev
This project consist of designing and modelling a common product : <strong>Lawn Mower</strong>.
#### To edit or modify the model open the file [`lawn_mower.FCStd`](lawn_mower.FCStd) in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/index.php).
#### Have a look at the 3-D model in the files [`lawn_mower.stl`](lawn_mower.stl) or [`lawn_mower.stl.glb`](lawn_mower.stl.glb). Note: since the files are large so github won't be able to render them. Try downloading them and then viewing them in a CAD software.
